# OFDM Performance Analysis in Multipath Propagation with MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation designed to analyze the performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) under multipath propagation conditions. This project includes support for both DQPSK (Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) and D8PSK (Differential 8 Phase Shift Keying) modulations. The aim is to evaluate the system's resilience to inter-symbol interference, which is prevalent in multipath environments.

## Key Features

- **Modulation Schemes**: Enhanced support for DQPSK and D8PSK, enabling a thorough performance analysis under varying modulation techniques.

- **Guard Interval and Cyclic Prefix Insertion**: Features include the insertion of a guard interval and a cyclic prefix at lengths of 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 of the current symbol length, aimed at mitigating the effects of inter-symbol interference.
- **Time Domain Modulation**: Implementation of traditional time domain modulation as a benchmark comparison to assess the efficacy of OFDM in handling multipath propagation and inter-symbol interference.

This project was developed as an academic assignment to explore OFDM's efficacy in handling multipath propagation effects. We extend our gratitude to the course instructors and fellow students for their support and constructive feedback throughout the project.
